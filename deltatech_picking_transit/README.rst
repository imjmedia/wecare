Features:

-  On the stock picking type form you can add "next operation"
-  when you make an internal transfer with a picking type that has the
   "next operation" set, the system gives you the option to make the
   transfer a 2 step one with the button "create transfer"
-  the button will create another transfer from the transit location to
   the location selected on the wizard with the same move lines
-  after the second transfer is created, you will not be able to modify
   the move lines of the initial transfer
