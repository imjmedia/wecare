Summary of SAT Financial Factoring
----------------------------------

When the Factoree (`Factorado`) approaches to Financial Factor (`Factorante`)
with a batch of invoices to be collected to a Customer. Factoree relinquishes
its rights to claim the collection of the invoices and in exchange it receives
a money share - let us say 80% - of the total of the invoices to collect (First
Payment).

The Financial Factor invoices the Factoree its Loaning Services - it can be 5%
the total amount to collect. These Loaning Services serve the basis for a
compensation made to the invoices involved in the financial factoring - that is
the name of this kind of transaction. Thus it serves as Second Payment. So
Financial Factor is withholding 15% of the total of the invoices to collect.
That amount serves as warranty.

At Due Date Financial Factor approaches Customer to collect the dued invoices.
If successful, then Financial Factor releases the withheld warranty minus the
interest - Let it be 3% of total amount. Thus the amount released is 12%. Here
we have two transactions: the released warranty (Third Payment) and the
interest that is to be invoiced by the Financial Factor to the Factoree which
will be used to compensate and ultimately fully pay the Customer invoices
(Fourth Payment).

It is to be noticed that all payments and compensations are to be signed (CFDI
XML) on Financial Factor's name not on Customer's. Though from the accounting
point of view the customer has being paying its invoices.

Billing because of Loaning Services and Loaning Interest and Warranty
Withholding vary upon trust of the parties - Financial Factor and the Factoree.
